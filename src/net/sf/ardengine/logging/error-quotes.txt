Why? Why? Whyyyyyyyy?
Hey, I know what is screwed!
Please give this to author of code. No kicking and screaming would help too.
I'd never crash you down!
ArdEngine is falling, wish something!
while(trying) throw new AnnoyingError("Bazinga!");
Guess what?
You'll fix it next time. Maybe another time. Well at least one day in far future you'll fix it.
This can't be good, is it?
I tried so hard and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter!
The flying squirrels conspiracy definitely did this!
Best not working code ever!
Don't care about warnings, that's why there's so many errors!
Need  \nmore  \ntea!
Ouch!
Well, try to see it from brighter side... oh.
Sabotage!
I might even know what went wrong...
This code is so wrong, that even if it could travel back in time, it would fail once again.
I'm trying doprdele!
Q: Did it work? A: Nope!
Probability of success: 0
:-(
The ultimate solution is... 42
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
I know what's wrong, it's broken!
HERE BE DRAGONS
HERE BE UNDEAD DRAGONS SELLING WASHING MACHINES AND 3D PRINTERS
Definitely not my fault!
Let's make something which works next time...
Generic ERROR message
Machal, it fell.
